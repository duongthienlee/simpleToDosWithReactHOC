# Simple Todos App using React HOC 
Eventhough react has already released react hook which will solve some tedious situations when using React HOC.
But I have never tried this React HOC approach, so just give it a try to understand why react hook helps to solve it.
In addition, I have never tried material-ui react component, so this repo is how I learn to use it
### The application using material-ui for styling
### Boilerplate is from my own webpack configuration repo
### Color Palette
I have some favorite colors and decided to create a simple color palette using this amazing tool from material
